# Campus Nord (UPC) paths and signs generator
Using a self-created map of the Campus Nord (UPC) where HackUPC is held, it computes the shortest path from a given place to another. Furthermore, it automatically creates the signs to be put on each point so hackers don't get lost. Just tell teh system which points do you want to put a sign on and it will generate them for you.
