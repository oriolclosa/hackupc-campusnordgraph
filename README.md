# Campus Nord (UPC) paths and signs generator
Using a self-created map of the Campus Nord (UPC) where HackUPC is held, it computes the shortest path from a given place to another. Furthermore, it automatically creates a JSON with the signs content to be put on each point so hackers don't get lost. Just tell the system which points do you want to put a sign on and where should they give indications to and it will generate them for you. But not only this, you will also get the approximate distance in meters for every route on each sign!

## Requirements
It's just a C++ program, so you'll need just any compiler, GCC is okay. Be aware that it uses some C++11 functions and so you'll need at least this version of C++.

## Usage
Change the `placesSigns` function and add any points where you would like to put signs on, you can also follow this ID with all the codes of the places you want them to be on the sign. Compile, run and there you go, a ready to be converted JSON!

### Graph reference
Beware that the code for any place is created by concatenating the identifier of the building, the floor and a number with hyphens. For example, if we want to identify the possible sign number 7 in the floor 0 of the A6 building, the code for it would be `A6-0-7`.

### Result example
If you run the code without any changes, you should get the following result.

```
